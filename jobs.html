       This is one of two part of web development. 
       For the people that are best skilled or has some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScripter and DOM 
       and using these programming languages to create websites. There are many jobs that a Front-end Developer can do,
       as there is many things you can do with code.

       Think of it a little like this: the back end developer is like the engineer who designs and creates the systems that make a 
       city work (electricity, water and sewer, zoning, etc.), while the front end developer is the one who lays out the streets and makes 
       sure everything is connected properly so people can live their lives (a simplified analogy, but you get the rough idea). 
       A front end web developer is also in charge of making sure that there are no errors or bugs
       on the front end, as well as making sure that the design appears as itâ€™s supposed to across various platforms and browsers.
       There are many jobs that a Front-end Developer can do, these include are.

            The key job role of a back-end developer is to ensure that the data or services requested
            by the front-end system or software are delivered through programmatic means.
            Back-end developers also create and maintain the entire back-end of a system, which consists of the core application logic, databases, data and application
            integration, API and other back-end processes. Moreover, a back-end developer performs the testing and debugging of any back-end application or system.
